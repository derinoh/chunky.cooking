A low-carb twist of the Western BBQ Beef Burger. I love getting these from 
the local pizza place, but realized I could do my own for cheaper and better quality.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 4 hours
- üç≥ Cook time: 2 hours
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- 1 Frozen Package Bacon
- Beefy Onion Soup Mix
- 2-3 Large Onions
- 1.55 lbs ground beef
- 8 or more eggs (depending on how much you like eggs!)
- A bottle or two of your favorite BBQ sauce (Make sure it isn't five months out of date)
- Corn starch
- Flour
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Mustard powder
- Pepper
- Milk (Use buttermilk if you're feeling fancy!)
- Olive oil
- Your favorite type of salt

## Directions

1. Thinly slice all onions from whole (I recommend getting a mandoline!)
2. Split the onion slivers into two groups (halves)
3. Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a pan over medium heat
4. Add one half of the onions to the pan and let them cook until soft and carmelized
5. Chop up the frozen bacon into little pieces and add to the onions
6. Put the other half of the onions in a big bowl and coat with milk
7. Grab two plates and one should have a mound of corn starch and the another a mound of flour
8. Add your salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to each plate and mix
(TIP: Add as much seasoning as you like and taste! Diverse cultures love to eat cornstarch so it's totally safe and yummy!)
9. Separate the onions from the milk and let drain a bit (keep the milk)
10. Dredge the onions in corn starch, then in the flour. If you want a double crisp fried onion you can
dip in the milk again and dredge the onions again (repeat as desired)
11. Once the bacon and grilled onions are done, drain and set aside. 
12. Add an inch or two of olive oil to a deep pan and heat on medium high
(TIP: Turn on the stove fan if it starts to smoke!)
13. Carefully place the flour/cornstarch coated onions in the hot oil
14. Fry until golden brown and drain on a paper towel laden plate
15. Sprinkle as much salt as you like
(TIP: You can taste some to see if it's seasoned properly!)
16. Grab a big bowl and fill with the ground beef, beefy onion soup mix, two eggs, and all spices (not allspice!)
17. Mix enough to incorporate into the beef, don't overmix!
18. Here's where you can be creative! If you want to make burgers you can roll into burgers and fry or grill them!
You could also just make beef crumbles by just putting it all in a pan and chopping with a spatula! The possibilities
are endless!
19. Once brown and cooked to an internal temperature deemed safe by the FDA you may
drain the beef and put on another paper towl laden plate. Pat dry.
20. Using the burger pan you can fry up eggs sunny-side up. Don't break the yolks or you have to throw them out
and start all over again
21. Grab the biggest bowl you have and put the beef, grilled onions, and bacon into it
22. Add enough BBQ sauce to coat or add as much as you like, just make sure it's not five months out of date!
23. Add any last minute seasonings such as salt and pepper 
24. Top with your eggs and fried onions, let the yolks run over everything!
25. Hope you didn't forget about that milk! Transfer to a glass with ice for the tastiest flavored milk you've ever had!
The milk will be infused with lost nutrients and give you all the vitamins and minerals you would have otherwise 
missed out on! 

There you have it! A delicious dinner that will keep you satisfied until tomorrow!
