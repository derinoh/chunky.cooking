Here's a quick snack that I just whipped up. Tomorrow is Cinco De Mayo and I thought what better way
to celebrate Cinco De Mayo eve with a fresh Chunky-approved take on my favorite Mexican food: Tacos!

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 5 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients 

- 1 bag of Idahoan Instant Mashed Potatoes
- Your favorite bologna slices
- Butter
- Milk

## Directions

1. Follow the instructions on the bag of mashed potato mix - mix water, butter, milk, and salt in a bowl and microwave it for like 5 minutes. 
2. Pour the mashed potato mix into the bowl and stir until it resembles mashed potatoes.
3. Lay out a few bologna slices onto a plate and scoop some of your freshly-made mashed potatoes onto each one (Careful! The potatoes might still be hot to touch!).
4. Fold the bologna around the mashed potatoes for each one and form a nice little meat taco with it
5. Enjoy!
