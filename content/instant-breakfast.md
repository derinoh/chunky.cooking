Time for a dish with fresh, healthy ingredients this time!

This dish brings back fond memories of growing up. Every morning mom would put some raw bacon
strips and eggs in the microwave for me to cook and eat myself before I went to school. 
I feel like a lot of people try to be too complicated when they are making food. Food
is meant to be simple, I think it's really humans who are injecting their complexities
into the cooking process and making it less human as a result.

This was probably the true start to my culinary career, and if you're new to cooking like 
I was, maybe this dish will spark that same passion in you. This is an American breakfast staple
that anyone can make with enough practice.

## Ingredients 

- bacon
- eggs

## Directions

1. Put 5 strips of your favorite raw bacon on a plate
2. Put it in the microwave for 8-10 minutes (10 minutes if you like it crispy like me)
3. While the bacon is cooking, crack open 3 eggs into a large coffee cup (watch out for shells!). Take a fork and stir the eggs if you like them scrambled. 

*BONUS CHUNKY TIP: Dump some Kraft cheese powder from a mac and cheese packet into the eggs for extra nummies*

4. Microwave the eggs for 30-45 seconds. They cook fast!
5. Salt the eggs to taste
6. Dump the cooked eggs onto the plate of bacon or just eat them out of the cup if you need them on the go.
